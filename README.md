# Overview

When using the reverse proxy [Træfik](https://traefik.io) in a local setup one may have the need to create custom Avahi cnames like `traefik.local` automatically when a container is created and routed by traefik. This helper container provides a Go binary which handles the communication to both the Docker daemon and the avahi daemon.
